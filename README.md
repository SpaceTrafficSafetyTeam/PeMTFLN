## Abstract

Nonlinear platoon dynamics modeling is essential for predicting and optimizing vehicle interactions. However, existing approaches often struggle to capture platoon-scale interaction features while maintaining both high accuracy and physical analyzability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel **Physics-encoded Deep Learning Network (PeMTFLN)** for modeling nonlinear vehicle platoon dynamics. The framework features an **Analyzable Parameters Encoded Computational Graph (APeCG)** to ensure physically consistent and stable platoon responses, and a **Multi-scale Trajectory Feature Learning Network (MTFLN)** to learn driving patterns from trajectory data. Trained on the HIGHSIM dataset, PeMTFLN outperforms baseline models in prediction accuracy and successfully replicates real-world platoon stability and safety characteristics, demonstrating a superior balance of predictive accuracy and physical interpretability.

## Framework

The overall architecture of our proposed **Parameters Encoder Multi-scale Trajectory Feature Learning Network (PeMTFLN)** integrates a multi-scale feature learning network (MTFLN) to learn driving patterns from data and an analyzable parameters encoded computational graph (APeCG) to ensure physical consistency and stability.

## Main Contributions

* **A novel vehicle platoon dynamics modeling framework (PeDL) with both interpretability and high accuracy is proposed.** It focuses on directly learning and encoding the physical parameters of a generalized platoon model and can be scaled to model platoons with varying numbers of vehicles.
* **A multi-scale trajectory feature learning network (MTFLN) is designed** to facilitate the end-to-end learning of the parameters required by PeDL, capturing features at both vehicle and platoon levels.
* **The model's effectiveness is validated on the real-world HIGH-SIM dataset.** PeMTFLN accurately reproduces platoon following behavior, including stability and safety evolution, and shows robust generalization on the NGSIM dataset.

## Environment Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/HaoLyu666/PeMTFLN.git](https://github.com/HaoLyu666/PeMTFLN.git)
cd PeMTFLN
```

**2. Create a Conda Environment (Recommended):**
```bash
conda create -n pemtfln python=3.8
conda activate pemtfln
```

**3. Install Dependencies:**
This project relies on several Python libraries. You can install them via pip.
```bash
pip install torch numpy tqdm pandas matplotlib
# Install PyTorch according to your CUDA version
# e.g., for CUDA 11.3:
# pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 -f [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html)
```
* **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04
* **CUDA Version**: 11.4
* **PyTorch Version**: 1.12.1+

## Data Preparation

* **Dataset**: The primary dataset is extracted from **HIGH-SIM**, containing platoon trajectories of seven vehicles. Generalization experiments are conducted on the **NGSIM** dataset.
* **Data Format**: The preprocessed data is stored in a `.npz` file (`platoons_data_split.npz`), which contains training, validation, and test sets. The data loading logic can be found in `loader2.py`.
* **Data Structure**: Each data sample consists of `hist` (historical trajectory features like gap, speed, etc.), `fut` (future ground truth gap and speed), and `nextv` (the lead vehicle's future velocity). This structure is defined in `loader2.py`.

## Usage

### Configuration

All hyperparameters for the model and training process are defined in `config.py`. You can modify this file to adjust settings like `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, `in_length`, `out_length`, etc.

### Model Training

Run the following script to start training the model. Model checkpoints will be saved in the `checkponint/` directory, and results will be logged in the `result/` directory. The training process is detailed in `train_highsim.py`.
```bash
python train_highsim.py
```

### Model Evaluation

After training, use the `evaluate_highsim.py` script to evaluate the model's performance on the test set. You need to specify the model epoch to load by modifying the `names` variable within the script.
```bash
# In evaluate_highsim.py, modify the 'names' variable
# names = '20' # Loads the model from the 20th epoch

python evaluate_highsim.py
```
